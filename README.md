An attempt to get reveal.js working in a Phoenix application. **WHY?** Purely
because I want to get more familiar with Phoenix and specifically how to deploy
a Phoenix project to Heroku.

## Helpful links
Here is a [blog post from October 2014](http://learnelixir.com/blog/2014/10/15/deploy-phonenix-application-to-heroku-server/)
with instructions which are not completely working today. Possibly due to changes in
Phoenix and possibly due to me not executing the instructions properly.

Here is a new tutorial, http://wsmoak.net/2015/07/12/phoenix-and-ecto-from-mix-new-to-heroku.html

To start your new Phoenix application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
